# js30
My projects done for Wes Bos js30 course. I try implementing advanced functionality for each project to enhance my own learning process. This document contains general information, thoughts, private notes and ideas.
## 01_jsDrumkit
##### todo:

## 02_jsClock
##### todo:
- [ ] Add background color based on hand position (a classic)
- [ ] Remove weird transition reset after 60s is full
##### possible project ideas:
- CSS world clock. Add up to 8 clocks with different time zones to page, all shiny & nice with CSS variables changing color according to time.

Everytime there is a change it gets mirrored to local storage.
Event delegation: Listen for a click on something "higher" + run function, inside the function we look if the target clicked is the item we want.
